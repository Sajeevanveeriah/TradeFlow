---

### Phase 2: Get Your First 10 Customers (Weeks 2-4)

#### Strategy 1: Personal Network (FREE)

2. Text/call them:
   ```
   "Hey! I built a scheduling app for tradies.
   Want to try it free for 30 days?
   Could save you 5 hours/week on admin."
   ```
3. Offer **30-day trial** instead of 14 (special for early users)
4. Ask for feedback and testimonials

**Expected result**: 5-10 beta users in first month

**Do this:**
1. Join Australian tradie Facebook groups:

   ```
   "Hey tradies! I built TradeFlow to help manage bookings
   and stop double-bookings. Free trial, Australian-made,
   includes GST calculations. Would love your feedback!"

2. Propose: "TradeFlow integrates with hipages - tradies can accept jobs directly into their calendar"
3. They promote you to their 33,000 tradies
4. You pay them 20% of revenue from referrals

**Expected result**: 100-500 new customers in 6 months

#### Strategy 2: Affiliate Program

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ‚ùå **"I'll add more features first"**
   - Your app is already better than what 86% of tradies use (pen and paper!)
   - Get customers FIRST, add features based on feedback

2. ‚ùå **"I'll wait until it's perfect"**
   - It's already production-ready!
   - Launch now, improve as you go

3. ‚ùå **"I'll just put up a website and wait"**
   - You need to actively find customers
   - Call tradies, post in groups, visit suppliers

4. ‚ùå **"I'll charge less to get more customers"**
   - $29/month is already very cheap
   - Tradies spend $200/week on fuel - they'll pay $29/mo for this

---

**You have:**
- ‚úÖ A complete, working SaaS application
- ‚úÖ Payment processing set up (Stripe)

## Questions?

**"How much coding do I need to know?"**
- Zero. The app is complete. You just deploy it and get customers.

**"Do I need to maintain the code?"**
- No. The app will run fine. You might add features later based on customer requests.

**"What if something breaks?"**
- Open a GitHub issue. The error logs in Vercel will tell you what happened.

**"How do I get paid?"**
- Stripe deposits money to your bank account automatically.

**"Is this legal?"**
- Yes. You own the code. Get an ABN, register for GST if you make >$75k/year.

**"Can I sell this business later?"**
- Yes! SaaS businesses sell for 3-5x annual revenue. A $100k/year business = $300-500k sale price.

**Stop thinking. Start deploying. Get customers. Make money.** üí∞
